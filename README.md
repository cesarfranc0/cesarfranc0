## App Brainstorming 

Here are three of my favorite apps and why:

Retro Bowl:

- 8 bit style
- Uses teams from the NFL to make game feel more real

Doordash:

- Easy to Read UI
- Access to a plethora of foods

MyFitnessPal:

- Easily to implement calorie tracker with almost every single food documented on the app
- Ability to view the amount of steps one has done


When I think about an app that I would like to make, I think about an app that recommends hobbies based on one's desires 
(Ex someone wanting to be a better person, recommend praying, going to the gym)

## Notes

Though simple, it took a bit of time to grasp the concept of using a UI and coding in a different language.
